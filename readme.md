# Concentration Game

## Pitch:

Look for pairs of cards by turning them over in, 2 at a time. The goal is to match all cards before time runs out. When a user clicks on a card it flips around. If you find a match, you get a point. When you start there's a timer set to some time that I haven't decided on. After a third unsuccessful match extra seconds will be taken from your clock.

Board size will be 6x6

## Tech Stack:

HTML, CSS (flexbox, grid), Vanilla JavaScript

## MVP GOALs

- To have 6x6 grid layed out
- with cards upside down,
- on click cards turn over 2 at a time,
- if not a match turn two cards over and try again,
- after three unsuccessful match shave some time off the timer,
- timer working,
- reset button,
- when timer is done show some kind of a popup for players results,
- keep a point system of how many maches a player got,
- after each reset shuffle cards.

## STRETCH Goals

- two levels: Hard - 6x6 grid, Easy - 4x4 grid.
- mobile friendly layout
- Marvel themed
- Sound when there's a match

## Potential Roadblocks

- reshuffling cards algorithm,
- after three unsuccessful match shave some time off the timer,
- if not a match turn two cards over and try again.
